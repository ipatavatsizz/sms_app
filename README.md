# SMS App (dev)

SMS App is a background sms listening app for my personal purposes. Uses `Workmanager` package and in every 15 minutes, restarts itself and listens sms using `Telephony` package.

## Technologies

> Uses `Workmanager`, `Telephony`, `Vibration`, and `Isar` packages.

#### Developer Note:

I want to mention that this project has enhanced my technical Flutter knowledge when solving something background services, I tried other packages such as `android_alarm_manager`, `android_foreground_service` etc. but none of them actually responded my needs. As a result of a long time research and trying-failing processes, finally, it is almost completely done.
